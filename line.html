            <h3>This is a graph of all the car crashes in January at zip code 11207, which was the highest crashed zip code.</h3>
            <h3>From this, we can see that January the 21st at zip code 11207 is the worst place to drive in New York City.</h3>
            <h3>If you are ever planning to go to New York City and drive there, avoid zip code 11207, and avoid the month of January, especially on the 21st.</h3>
            <h3>On the next page is an interactive graph. Pick your zip code and month to see the number of crashes that day.</h3>
