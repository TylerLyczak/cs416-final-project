            <h3>January and Feburary have a staggering more crashes then all the other months.</h3>
            <h3>We can see how July through May is mostly the same, but January and Feburary have more than 7000 crashes compared to each month.</h3>
            <h3>Knowing New York City, we know that it can get cold and snow a lot there.</h3>
            <h3>Looking at data from www.currentresults.com, based off a 10-year average snowfall, we can see the average snow fall in January is 12.9 inches and Feburary is 11.8 inches</h3>
            <h3>The third closest month is March, which only has 6.0 inches. </h3>
            <h3>Let's investigate January more and see what the worst day to drive in New York is.</h3>
