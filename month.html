            <h3>January and February have staggering more crashes than all the other months.</h3>
            <h3>We can see how July through May is mostly the same, but January and February have a lot more crashes compared to each month.</h3>
            <h3>We can see going from all zips to 11207 that the trends stay the same.</h3>
            <h3>Knowing New York City, we know that it can get cold and snow a lot there.</h3>
            <h3>Looking at data from www.currentresults.com, based on a 10-year average snowfall, we can see the average snowfall in January is 12.9 inches and February is 11.8 inches.</h3>
            <h3>The third closest month is March, which only has 6.0 inches.</h3>
            <h3>Let's investigate January more and see what the worst day to drive in New York is.</h3>
