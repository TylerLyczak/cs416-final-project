        <h3>We are going to take a look at car crash statistics in New York City.</h3>
        <h3>Through this interactive slideshow, we are going to learn about what area is the worst to drive in and what day and month also.</h3>
        <h3>This is meant that if you do plan on driving through New York City, you should avoid this area, month and day.</h3>
